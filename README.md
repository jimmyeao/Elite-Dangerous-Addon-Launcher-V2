# Elite Dangerous Addon Launcher V2

The purpose of this program is to allow you to choose which apps and websites to launch when you run Elite, and optionally close the apps when you close the Elite launcher.

if you want this to be your default profile, tick the default box!
Now you can add some apps by hitting the Add App button:

Remeber to tick the enabled button if you want it enabled. Dont worry if you forget, you can change it later!
If you use T.A.R.G.E.T or any other software that requires arguments (e.g. /vr for running elite in VR) just add them in:

NOTE For some reason, windows defender was flagging this as a Trojan, probably because the code executes other programs - it has been submitted to Microsoft for analysis:
