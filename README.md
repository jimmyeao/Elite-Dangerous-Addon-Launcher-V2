# Elite Dangerous Addon Launcher V2

The purpose of this program is to allow you to choose which apps and websites to launch when you run Elite, and optionally close the apps when you close the Elite launcher.

The first thing you will want to do is create a profile, i have 2 named VR and Non VR.
Click Add Profile and give it a name:

if you want this to be your default profile, tick the default box!
Now you can add some apps by hitting the Add App button: (NOTE as a minimum, you need to add edlaunch.exe!)

TIP use /autorun /autoexit on edlaunch as arguments to automatically launch elite once the launcher has loaded, and exit the launcher when exiting the game

Remeber to tick the enabled button if you want it enabled. Dont worry if you forget, you can change it later!
If you use T.A.R.G.E.T or any other software that requires arguments (e.g. /vr for running elite in VR) just add them in:

You can also add websites:

Note the Close Apps on Exit checkbox, this will attempt to close all the apps it has launched when the Elite Dangerous Launcher has been closed.
 
# Tips

 You can drag and drop items to re-order them.

 You can right click items to add them to another profile:

You can pass command line arguments - create a shortcut and add
/profile="profilename" /autolaunch
to automatically load a profile and launch the apps. Please note, if you get the profile name wrong, the app will just exit!

NOTE For some reason, windows defender was flagging this as a Trojan, probably because the code executes other programs - it has been submitted to Microsoft for analysis and shown tro be clean:
